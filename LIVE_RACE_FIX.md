# Live Race Tracking Fix - Summary

## Problem
The PTTiming scraper was overly complex and unreliable:
- Used Puppeteer to launch a headless browser
- Attempted to navigate, click elements, and wait for page loads
- Had long timeouts (30+ seconds) and complex DOM manipulation
- Often failed to extract data from the live results page

## Solution
Simplified the scraper to directly access the Firebase data source:
- **Before**: 450+ lines of Puppeteer browser automation code
- **After**: ~100 lines of direct HTTP requests using node-fetch

### Key Changes

1. **Direct Firebase Access**
   - Extracted meet ID from URL: `mid=7388` → `7388`
   - Fetch data directly: `https://ptt-franklin.firebaseio.com/{meetId}.json`
   - No browser needed - just a simple HTTP GET request

2. **Correct Field Mappings**
   - **Athlete Name**: `entry.A.N` (Full name)
   - **School/Team**: `entry.TN` (Team Name at entry level)
   - **Place**: `entry.P` (Place/Position)
   - **Time**: `entry.M` (Mark/Time, e.g., "19:21.0")
   - **Race Title**: Combined `Meta.name` + `event.E.N`

3. **Data Structure**
   ```javascript
   Firebase Response:
   {
     Meta: {
       name: "NCAA DI Cross Country Championships"
     },
     MeetEvents: {
       "1-1": {
         EN: "1",
         E: { N: "6000m" },
         ED: {
           "entry-id": {
             A: { N: "Athlete Name" },
             TN: "School Name",
             P: 1,
             M: "19:21.0"
           }
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Results
The scraper now:
- ✅ Fetches data in <1 second (vs 30+ seconds before)
- ✅ Correctly extracts school names
- ✅ Correctly extracts finish times
- ✅ Provides descriptive race titles
- ✅ Works reliably without browser dependencies

## Testing
Tested with URL: `https://live.pttiming.com/xc-ptt.html?mid=7388`

Sample output:
```
Race Title: NCAA DI Cross Country Championships - 6000m
Total Results: 255

1. Doris Lemngole (Alabama) - 19:21.0
2. Pamela Kosgei (New Mexico) - 19:27.8
3. Hilda Olemomoi (Florida) - 19:28.7
```

## Usage
The live race tracking feature can now be used in the app:
1. Navigate to a draft
2. Click "Live Race Tracking"
3. Enter a PTTiming URL (e.g., `https://live.pttiming.com/xc-ptt.html?mid=7388`)
4. Click "Start Live Tracking"
5. Results will update every 10 seconds automatically

## Benefits
- **Faster**: <1 second vs 30+ seconds
- **More reliable**: No browser dependencies or DOM manipulation
- **Simpler**: 78% less code to maintain
- **Cost effective**: No need for Puppeteer (still installed but not used)
