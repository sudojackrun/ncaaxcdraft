# ðŸš€ Cross Country Draft - Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide will help you deploy your cross country draft application for ~10 users. The app is now secured with admin password protection and ready for production use.

## Security Features Implemented âœ…

### 1. Admin Password Protection
- All dangerous operations require admin password:
  - Import data from TFRRS
  - Delete athletes
  - Migrate grades
  - Bulk operations

### 2. Role-Based Access
- **Admin (You)**: Full access to import, delete, and manage data
- **Regular Users (Friends)**: Can view athletes, participate in drafts, manage their teams

### 3. Rate Limiting
- 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
- Prevents abuse and excessive API usage

### 4. Environment Variables
- Sensitive configuration stored in `.env` file
- Not committed to version control

## Before Deployment

### 1. Set Admin Password
Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
cd /Users/jack/cross-country-draft
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and set a **strong** admin password:

```env
ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_super_secret_password_here
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=production
```

**IMPORTANT**:
- Use a strong password (at least 16 characters, mix of letters, numbers, symbols)
- Never share this password publicly
- Don't commit `.env` file to git

### 2. Update CORS for Production
Edit `server/index.js` and update the CORS configuration for your production domain:

```javascript
// Replace this:
app.use(cors());

// With this (replace with your actual domain):
app.use(cors({
  origin: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? 'https://yourdomain.com'
    : 'http://localhost:5173'
}));
```

### 3. Update WebSocket URL
Edit `client/src/pages/DraftBoard.jsx` and `client/src/pages/DraftRoomEnhanced.jsx`:

```javascript
// Replace this:
const websocket = new WebSocket(`ws://localhost:3001/ws`);

// With this (replace with your actual domain):
const websocket = new WebSocket(
  process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
    ? `wss://yourdomain.com/ws`
    : `ws://localhost:3001/ws`
);
```

## Deployment Options

### Option 1: Railway.app (Recommended - Easiest)

Railway offers free tier perfect for small apps like yours.

1. **Install Railway CLI**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @railway/cli
   ```

2. **Login to Railway**:
   ```bash
   railway login
   ```

3. **Initialize Project**:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/jack/cross-country-draft
   railway init
   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   railway variables set ADMIN_PASSWORD="your_super_secret_password"
   railway variables set NODE_ENV="production"
   ```

5. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   railway up
   ```

6. **Get Your URL**:
   ```bash
   railway domain
   ```

Railway will automatically:
- Build your client and server
- Set up SQLite database persistence
- Provide HTTPS
- Handle WebSocket connections

### Option 2: Render.com (Also Easy)

1. Create account at https://render.com
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Create a "Web Service"
4. Configure:
   - **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build --workspace=client`
   - **Start Command**: `npm run dev:server`
   - **Environment Variables**: Add `ADMIN_PASSWORD`
5. Deploy!

### Option 3: DigitalOcean App Platform

1. Create account at https://digitalocean.com
2. Create new App
3. Connect GitHub repo
4. Configure environment variables
5. Deploy

### Option 4: VPS (More Control, More Setup)

If you want to run on your own VPS (DigitalOcean, Linode, etc.):

1. **Install Node.js** on server
2. **Clone your repo**
3. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
4. **Set up PM2** for process management:
   ```bash
   npm install -g pm2
   pm2 start server/index.js --name xc-draft
   pm2 startup
   pm2 save
   ```
5. **Set up Nginx** as reverse proxy
6. **Get SSL certificate** with Let's Encrypt/Certbot

## Post-Deployment Checklist

### Test Everything:
- [ ] Can access the site at your domain
- [ ] Drafts page loads and works
- [ ] TV Board view works (important for projecting!)
- [ ] WebSocket updates work in real-time
- [ ] Admin password protects import page
- [ ] Friends can participate in drafts without password

### Share With Friends:
1. **Send them the URL**: `https://yourdomain.com`
2. **Tell them**: No password needed for drafting
3. **Keep admin password secret**: Only you need it for imports

## Using the App

### For You (Admin):
1. Go to Import page
2. Enter admin password at top
3. Import meets from TFRRS
4. Manage athletes, delete high schoolers, migrate grades

### For Your Friends:
1. Go to main site
2. View athletes and meets (no password needed)
3. Participate in drafts
4. View their team rosters

### During Draft Night:
1. Set up draft at `/draft/setup`
2. Start the draft
3. Open TV Board by clicking "ðŸ“º TV Board" button
4. Project TV Board on your TV (full-screen mode with F11)
5. Everyone makes picks from the regular draft room
6. TV Board updates in real-time!

## TV Board Features ðŸŽ¯
The TV Board (`/draft/:id/board`) is optimized for projection:
- **Large, clean grid** showing all picks
- **Team columns** and **round rows**
- **Color-coded**:
  - Green: Completed picks
  - Orange: Current pick (on the clock)
  - Gray: Upcoming picks
- **Real-time updates** via WebSocket
- **Last pick highlight** at bottom
- **Dark theme** easy on the eyes

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Not Connecting
- Check CORS settings
- Ensure WebSocket URL matches your domain
- Use `wss://` for HTTPS sites, `ws://` for HTTP

### Admin Password Not Working
- Check `.env` file exists
- Restart server after changing `.env`
- Clear browser cache

### Rate Limiting Issues
If you hit the rate limit (100 req/15min):
- Wait 15 minutes
- Check for infinite loops in frontend
- Adjust limit in `server/index.js` if needed

### Database Issues
Your SQLite database is at `server/db/draft.db`:
- Backup regularly: `cp server/db/draft.db server/db/draft.db.backup`
- Don't delete this file!

## Maintenance

### Backups
```bash
# Backup database
cp server/db/draft.db backups/draft-$(date +%Y%m%d).db

# Backup weekly (add to cron)
0 0 * * 0 cp /path/to/server/db/draft.db /path/to/backups/draft-$(date +%Y%m%d).db
```

### Updates
```bash
git pull
npm install
# Restart server (method depends on hosting platform)
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit `.env` file** to git
2. **Use strong admin password** (16+ characters)
3. **Keep admin password secret** - only you need it
4. **Monitor access logs** for suspicious activity
5. **Backup database regularly**
6. **Use HTTPS** in production (most platforms provide this automatically)

## Cost Estimates

For ~10 users with moderate usage:

- **Railway.app**: Free tier should be sufficient ($0/month)
- **Render.com**: Free tier works ($0/month)
- **DigitalOcean**: $4-6/month (cheapest droplet)
- **VPS**: $5-10/month

## Support

If you run into issues:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Check server logs
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Test locally first before debugging production

Your app is now secure and ready for 10 friends to use! The key features:

âœ… Admin password protects dangerous operations
âœ… Friends can draft without any passwords
âœ… Rate limiting prevents abuse
âœ… TV Board perfect for draft night
