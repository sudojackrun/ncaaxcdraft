This guide explains how to import real NCAA Division I cross country data from TFRRS.org into your draft app.

## What is TFRRS?

TFRRS (Track & Field Results Reporting System) at [tfrrs.org](https://www.tfrrs.org/) is the official results database for college track and field and cross country in the United States. It contains:

- Complete meet results for all NCAA divisions

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Navigate to Import Data**:

2. Find the 2025 NCAA DI Championships meet page
3. Copy the URL
4. Import using the "Custom Meet" option in your app

## Troubleshooting

### Import Fails or Times Out

**Problem**: TFRRS blocks automated requests if you import too frequently.

**Solution**:
- Wait 5-10 minutes before trying again
- Import one meet at a time
- TFRRS uses rate limiting to prevent server overload

### Athletes Have Wrong Gender

**Problem**: The scraper defaults athletes to 'M' (male) gender.

**Solution**:
- You can manually update athlete gender in the Athletes page
- Future versions may auto-detect based on race type

### Some Athletes Missing

**Problem**: Not all athletes from a meet are imported.

**Solution**:
- The scraper only imports athletes with complete data (name, school, time)
- DNS (Did Not Start) and DNF (Did Not Finish) athletes are typically excluded
- Check the import results summary to see how many athletes were imported

### Duplicate Athletes

**Problem**: Same athlete appears multiple times.

**Solution**:
- The system matches athletes by name AND school
- If a runner transferred schools, they may appear twice
- Manually delete duplicates from the Athletes page if needed

## Technical Details

### How Scraping Works

1. **HTTP Request**: The app sends a request to the TFRRS meet URL
2. **HTML Parsing**: Uses Cheerio to parse the results table
3. **Data Extraction**: Extracts athlete names, schools, places, and times
4. **Database Import**: Saves athletes and results to your SQLite database
5. **PR Updates**: Compares times and updates personal records

### Rate Limiting

TFRRS doesn't have a public API, so we use web scraping. The app includes:
- 1-second delay between requests
- User-Agent headers to identify requests
- Respectful scraping practices

### Data Privacy

- All scraped data is public information from TFRRS
- Data is stored locally in your SQLite database
- No data is sent to external servers
- Athlete TFRRS profile URLs are preserved for reference

## Best Practices

1. **Import Strategically**: Import the meets most relevant to your draft
2. **Start with Championships**: Import NCAA Championships first for top athletes
3. **Conference Meets**: Import conference championships for deeper athlete pools
4. **Check Before Drafting**: Navigate to Athletes to verify import was successful
5. **One at a Time**: Import meets one at a time to avoid rate limiting

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for the TFRRS import feature:

- [ ] Auto-detect athlete gender from race divisions
- [ ] Import athlete biographical data (grade, hometown)
- [ ] Scheduled imports for upcoming meets
- [ ] Import women's and men's races separately
- [ ] Historical season tracking (import multiple seasons)
- [ ] Export athlete data to CSV

## Support

If you encounter issues:

1. Check the browser console for error messages
2. Verify the TFRRS URL is correct and accessible
3. Wait a few minutes if rate-limited
4. File an issue on GitHub with meet URL and error message
