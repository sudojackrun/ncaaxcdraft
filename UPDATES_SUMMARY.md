# Updates Summary - Delete & Database Improvements

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

- Automatically removes associated results and draft picks
- Confirmation prompt before deletion

**Bulk Delete:**
- "Delete All Men" / "Delete All Women" / "Delete All Athletes" button

- ‚úÖ `pr_6k` & `pr_6k_seconds` - 6K times
- ‚úÖ `pr_8k` & `pr_8k_seconds` - 8K times

## üîç About the Meet Data Issue

You mentioned "the data that the meets are pulling is incorrect". To help me fix this, please tell me:

**What exactly is wrong?**

1. **Is it importing the wrong people?**
   - Example: Team names instead of athlete names?
   - Coaches or officials instead of runners?

2. **Is it importing the wrong race?**
   - Men's results when you wanted women's?
   - Different distance than expected?

3. **Are the times wrong?**
   - Incorrect times listed?
   - Times from wrong distance?

4. **Mixed gender results?**
   - Men and women combined when they should be separate?

5. **Something else?**
   - Please describe what you're seeing vs what you expect

### Current Scraper Behavior

When you import a meet, the scraper:
1. Looks for individual athlete results table
2. Skips team scores table
3. Auto-detects race distance (5K/6K/8K/10K)
4. Stores times in appropriate PR field
5. Sets gender based on meet config (M or F)

### Known Limitations

- **Gender detection**: Scraper doesn't auto-detect gender from race, uses meet config
- **Multi-race meets**: If a meet has both men's and women's races, it imports whichever comes first
- **Race distance**: Detects from page title, might not always be accurate

## Testing Instructions

1. **Delete your current bad data:**
   ```
   - Go to Athletes page
   - Click appropriate gender tab
   - Click "Delete All [Gender]"
   - Confirm twice
   ```

2. **Try importing again:**
   ```
   - Go to Import Data page
   - Try "2024 NCAA DI Championships - Men 10K"
   - Should import ~255 male athletes with 10K times
   ```

3. **Check the results:**
   ```
   - Go to Athletes page
   - Click "Men" tab
   - You should see:
     * Real athlete names (e.g., "Colin Sahlman")
     * Real schools (e.g., "Northern Arizona")
     * Times in the "10K PR" column
     * Grade numbers (9-12)
   ```

## Please Provide

To fix the meet import issues, please tell me:

1. **Which specific meet did you try to import?**
   - URL or meet name

2. **What did you get?**
   - How many "athletes" imported?
   - What are their names? (first few examples)
   - What's in the time columns?

3. **What should you have gotten?**
   - Expected number of athletes
   - Expected distance
   - Expected gender

This will help me debug the scraper and fix the specific issue you're seeing!

---

**Quick Fix:** If data is totally wrong, delete all athletes and try a different meet first to test the scraper.
