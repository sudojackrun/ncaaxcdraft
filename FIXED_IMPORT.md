# Import Fixed! ‚úÖ

## What Was Wrong

The scraper was importing **team results** (school names and team scores) instead of **individual athlete results**. TFRRS pages have both tables, and we were grabbing the wrong one.

## What I Fixed

### 1. **Scraper Now Targets Individual Results**
- Looks for athlete names (with links to profiles)
- Skips team score tables
- Validates data is actually athletes (has first + last name)
- Filters out DNS/DNF/DQ results

### 2. **Proper Race Distance Tracking**
Athletes now have separate PR fields for each distance:
- **pr_5k** & **pr_5k_seconds** - 5K personal record
- **pr_6k** & **pr_6k_seconds** - 6K personal record
- **pr_8k** & **pr_8k_seconds** - 8K personal record
- **pr_10k** & **pr_10k_seconds** - 10K personal record

The scraper automatically detects race distance and stores PRs in the correct field!

### 3. **Grade Information**
- Now imports athlete year/grade (FR/SO/JR/SR)
- Converts to grade level (9/10/11/12)

### 4. **Better Validation**
- Ensures we're importing athletes, not teams
- Requires at least 10 results (individual races have 100+)
- Checks for athlete profile links

## What You'll See Now

When you import a meet, you should get:

‚úÖ **Athlete names** (e.g., "Colin Sahlman", "Drew Griffith")
‚úÖ **Schools** (e.g., "Northern Arizona", "Oklahoma State")
‚úÖ **Grades** (9, 10, 11, or 12)
‚úÖ **Gender** (M or F)
‚úÖ **PRs** in the correct distance field (6K for women, 8K/10K for men)
‚úÖ **Times** (e.g., "23:45.2")

‚ùå NOT team names or team scores!

## Try It Again

1. **Restart your server**:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop if running
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Go to Import Data page**:
   http://localhost:3000/import

3. **Import a meet** (try NCAA DI Championships Men):
   - Should import 250+ individual athletes
   - Each with name, school, grade, time

4. **Check Athletes page**:
   - You should see real athlete names like:
     - Colin Sahlman (Northern Arizona)
     - Drew Griffith (Oklahoma State)
     - Gary Martin (North Carolina)
   - NOT school names like "Northern Arizona" in the name field

## Distance Detection

The scraper auto-detects race distance:
- **Men's NCAA XC** = 10K ‚Üí stores in pr_10k
- **Women's NCAA XC** = 6K ‚Üí stores in pr_6k
- **Conference meets** = Usually 8K (men) / 6K (women)

## What to Expect

**NCAA DI Championships (Men):**
- ~255 athletes
- All 10K times
- Stored in pr_10k field

**NCAA DI Championships (Women):**
- ~255 athletes
- All 6K times
- Stored in pr_6k field

**Conference Championships:**
- ~150-200 athletes per gender
- 8K (men) or 6K (women) typically

## If It Still Fails

Check the error message:

1. **"No individual athlete results found"**
   - The page might only have team scores
   - Try a different meet/division

2. **"Too few results"**
   - The scraper found < 10 results
   - Might be a relay or team-only event

3. **"TFRRS is blocking requests"**
   - Rate limited - wait 5-10 minutes
   - Import one meet at a time
