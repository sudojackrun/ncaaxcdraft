# üîí Security Implementation Summary

## What Was Done

This document summarizes all security and deployment features added to make your cross country draft app ready for production with ~10 users.

## 1. Admin Password Protection

### Backend (`server/middleware/adminAuth.js`)
Created middleware that checks for admin password in request headers:
- Reads `ADMIN_PASSWORD` from environment variables
- Validates `x-admin-password` header on protected routes
- Returns 401 Unauthorized if password is missing or incorrect

### Protected Endpoints
The following routes now require admin password:

**Athletes** (`server/routes/athletes.js`):
- `DELETE /api/athletes/:id` - Delete single athlete
- `DELETE /api/athletes/` - Delete all athletes
- `POST /api/athletes/delete-no-grade` - Delete athletes without grades
- `POST /api/athletes/migrate-grades` - Migrate athlete grades

**Import** (`server/routes/import-improved.js`):
- `POST /api/import/meet` - Import single meet
- `POST /api/import/auto-import/season` - Auto-import multiple meets
- `POST /api/import/bulk/current-season/:meetKey` - Bulk import specific meet

### Frontend Integration

**Athletes Page** (`client/src/pages/Athletes.jsx`):
- Prompts for admin password when using:
  - Delete athletes without grades
  - Migrate grades to current season
- Shows "Unauthorized" error if password is incorrect

**Import Page** (`client/src/pages/ImportDataImproved.jsx`):
- Admin password input field at top of page
- All import operations require password
- Clear error messages if password is missing/incorrect

## 2. Rate Limiting

### Implementation (`server/index.js`)
Added `express-rate-limit` middleware:
```javascript
const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // 100 requests per 15 min per IP
  message: 'Too many requests from this IP, please try again later.'
});
app.use('/api/', limiter);
```

**Benefits**:
- Prevents abuse/DoS attacks
- Limits each IP to 100 API requests per 15 minutes
- Should be more than enough for 10 users

## 3. Environment Variables

### Files Created
- `.env.example` - Template with default values
- `.env` - Actual environment file (not committed to git)

### Variables
```env
ADMIN_PASSWORD=changeme123  # Change this!
PORT=3001
NODE_ENV=development
```

### Usage
- Admin password stored securely in environment
- Easy to change without modifying code
- Different passwords for dev/production

## 4. TV Board Feature

### New Component (`client/src/pages/DraftBoard.jsx`)
Created dedicated TV-optimized draft board:
- Large, clean grid layout
- Shows all picks: Team columns √ó Round rows
- Color-coded picks:
  - Green: Completed
  - Orange: Current pick (on the clock)
  - Gray: Upcoming
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- Dark theme for easy viewing
- Perfect for projecting on TV during draft night

### Route Added
`/draft/:id/board` - Accessible via "üì∫ TV Board" button in draft room

### Features
- Full-screen friendly (press F11)
- No distractions - just the draft board
- Updates live as picks are made
- Shows "ON CLOCK" for current team
- Displays last pick at bottom

## 5. Documentation

## Access Control Summary

### Admin Access (Password Required)
You can:
- ‚úÖ Import meet data from TFRRS
- ‚úÖ Delete athletes (single or bulk)
- ‚úÖ Migrate athlete grades
- ‚úÖ Run bulk operations
- ‚úÖ Manage database

### Regular User Access (No Password)
Your friends can:
- ‚úÖ View all athletes and meets
- ‚úÖ Create and join drafts
- ‚úÖ Make draft picks
- ‚úÖ View team rosters
- ‚úÖ See live race results
- ‚úÖ Use TV Board view

### What's Protected
‚ùå Data import (TFRRS scraping)
‚ùå Delete operations
‚ùå Grade migration
‚ùå Bulk athlete management

### What's Open
‚úÖ View data (athletes, meets, teams)
‚úÖ Draft participation
‚úÖ Team management
‚úÖ Live tracking

## Security Best Practices Implemented

1. **Password Protection**: All dangerous operations require admin password
2. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse (100 req/15min per IP)
3. **Environment Variables**: Sensitive config not in code
4. **Input Validation**: TFRRS URLs validated before scraping
5. **Error Messages**: Don't leak sensitive information
6. **CORS**: Will be configured for production domain
7. **No User Data Storage**: No personal information collected from friends

## What You Need To Do

### Before Deployment:
1. ‚úÖ Set strong admin password in `.env`
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update CORS in `server/index.js` for your domain
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è Update WebSocket URLs for production
4. ‚úÖ Choose hosting platform (Railway/Render recommended)
5. ‚úÖ Set environment variables on hosting platform

### After Deployment:
1. ‚úÖ Test all features work
2. ‚úÖ Test admin password protection
3. ‚úÖ Test TV Board on actual TV
4. ‚úÖ Share URL with friends
5. ‚úÖ **Keep admin password secret!**

## Technical Details

### Admin Auth Flow
```
Client Request with x-admin-password header
    ‚Üì
Express Middleware (requireAdmin)
    ‚Üì
Check password === process.env.ADMIN_PASSWORD
    ‚Üì
‚úÖ Match: Continue to route handler
‚ùå No match: Return 401 Unauthorized
```

### Rate Limiting Flow
```
Client makes API request to /api/*
    ‚Üì
Rate limit middleware checks IP
    ‚Üì
Count requests in 15-minute window
    ‚Üì
< 100 requests: Allow ‚úÖ
‚â• 100 requests: Block with 429 ‚ùå
```

### TV Board Updates
```
Pick made in DraftRoom
    ‚Üì
POST /api/draft/:id/pick
    ‚Üì
Server updates database
    ‚Üì
WebSocket broadcast to all clients
    ‚Üì
DraftBoard receives update
    ‚Üì
Re-renders with new pick ‚ú®
```
