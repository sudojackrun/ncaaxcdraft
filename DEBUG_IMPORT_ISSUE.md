# Debug Import Issue - No Results Found

You're getting "No individual athlete results found" which means the scraper can't find any tables on the TFRRS page.

## Quick Diagnosis Tool

I've added a debug tool to help us figure out what's on the page!

### Step 1: Run the Debug Tool

**Restart your server:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

**Visit the debug page:**
```
http://localhost:3000/debug
```

### Step 2: Inspect the TFRRS Page

1. The URL is pre-filled with the NCAA Championships link
2. Click "Inspect Page"
3. Wait a few seconds

### Step 3: Check the Results

The tool will show you:

**If NO TABLES found:**
- TFRRS page might require JavaScript to load results
- Results might not be posted yet
- TFRRS might be blocking our requests
- The page format is completely different

**If TABLES found:**
- You'll see the table headers (column names)
- You'll see sample rows (first 3 rows of data)
- We can figure out which columns have what data

### Step 4: Report Back

Once you run the debug tool, tell me:

1. **How many tables found?**
   - 0, 1, 2, or more?

2. **What are the table headers?**
   - Example: ["Pl", "Name", "Yr", "Team", "Time"]

3. **What's in the sample rows?**
   - Are they athlete names or something else?
   - Do they have times in MM:SS format?

4. **What are the page headers (H1/H2/H3)?**
   - Does it say "Men's 10K" or "Women's 6K"?

## Alternative: Manual Check

If the debug tool doesn't work, manually check:

1. **Open the TFRRS link in your browser:**
   ```
   https://www.tfrrs.org/results/xc/25334/NCAA_DI_Championships
   ```

2. **Check if results load:**
   - Do you see athlete names and times?
   - Is it an HTML table or something else?

3. **Right-click â†’ View Page Source**
   - Search for "Parker Wolfe" (should be in men's results)
   - See if it's in an HTML `<table>` tag

4. **Check the page structure:**
   - Are there separate sections for Men and Women?
   - How are they labeled?

## Possible Issues

### 1. TFRRS Changed Format
TFRRS might have changed their page structure. They could be using:
- JavaScript to load results
- A different table format
- JSON data instead of HTML tables

### 2. TFRRS Blocking Requests
TFRRS might be blocking automated requests:
- Returns empty page for bots
- Requires cookies or special headers
- Rate limiting kicked in

### 3. Results Not Posted Yet
The meet page might exist but results aren't posted:
- Check manually if results are visible in browser
- Try a different, older meet

## Workarounds

If TFRRS scraping doesn't work, you have options:

### Option 1: Try Different Meets
Some older meets might have different format:
```
https://www.tfrrs.org/results/xc/24523/2024_Mountain_West_Cross_Country_Championships
```

### Option 2: Manual Import
I can add a CSV upload feature where you:
1. Copy/paste results from TFRRS
2. Upload a CSV file
3. Manually enter athletes

### Option 3: Use Results Service APIs
Some timing services have APIs:
- Athletic.net
- MileSplit
- Direct timing company APIs

## Next Steps

**Run the debug tool and share what you find!**

Then we can:
1. Fix the scraper to handle the actual format
2. Switch to a different approach
3. Add manual import features

**Go to:** http://localhost:3000/debug

**Share:**
- Screenshot of the debug results
- OR copy/paste the "Raw Data" section
- OR tell me what you see

This will help me fix the scraper! ðŸ”§
