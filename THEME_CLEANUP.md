## Changes Made

- **After**: "NCAA XC DRAFT" - clean and readable
- Removed animated stars (::before/::after)
- Reduced title font size from 1.2rem to 1rem
- Simplified text-shadow for better readability

### 📏 Fixed Text Overflow

#### Global Fixes
- Added `word-wrap: break-word` and `overflow-wrap: break-word` to all text elements
- Added `hyphens: auto` for better text breaking
- Set `max-width: 100%` on card text to prevent overflow

#### Specific Fixes
1. **Navigation Title**
   - Added `white-space: nowrap` with `text-overflow: ellipsis`
   - Title now truncates gracefully if too long

2. **Card Titles**
   - Reduced font-size from 1.2rem to 1rem
   - Added `line-height: 1.4` for better spacing
   - Added `word-wrap: break-word`

3. **Draft Card Titles**
   - Font-size: 0.75rem (from 0.85rem)
   - Added `flex: 1` to allow proper wrapping
   - Added gap between title and delete button

4. **All Headings (h2, h3)**
   - Added word-wrap and overflow-wrap
   - Ensures long draft names don't break layout

5. **Badge Text**
   - Reduced font-size to 0.55rem
   - Ensures badges fit on one line

### 🎨 Cleaned Up Decorations

#### Card Decorations
- **Before**: Animated waving flag (⚑) on every card header
- **After**: Removed - cleaner look
- **Before**: Complex grass stripe pattern on card bottom
- **After**: Simple 4px green border (subtle accent)

#### Trophy Icons
- **Before**: 🏆 trophy on roster cards and completed drafts
- **After**: Removed - less visual clutter

#### Success Button Runner
- **Before**: All success buttons had 🏃 emoji prefix
- **After**: Removed - cleaner button text

### 📐 Font Size Adjustments

| Element | Before | After | Reason |
|---------|--------|-------|--------|
| Nav Title | 1.2rem | 1rem | Better fit, less overwhelming |
| Card Title | 1.2rem | 1rem | Prevents overflow |
| Draft Card Title | 0.85rem | 0.75rem | More space for long names |
| Badge Text | 0.6rem | 0.55rem | Fits better in small spaces |
| Button Text | 0.7rem | 0.6rem (cards) | Proportional sizing |

### ✨ What Stayed

Kept the essential 8-bit elements:
- ✅ Press Start 2P pixel font
- ✅ Green grass background
- ✅ Chunky 4px pixel borders
- ✅ Button press/lift animations
- ✅ Red championship banner
- ✅ Pixel-style badges
- ✅ Box shadow depth effects
- ✅ Track-red color scheme
- ✅ Retro status indicators (LIVE, DONE, READY)
- ✅ One emoji: 🏁 checkered flag for empty state

### 🎯 Result

The theme now has:
- **Better readability** - Less emoji clutter
- **Professional look** - Clean while still retro
- **No text overflow** - Everything fits in containers
- **Faster scanning** - Easier to find information
- **Maintained personality** - Still fun 8-bit aesthetic
- **Better UX** - Less visual noise, clearer actions

### 📱 Responsive Improvements

Text overflow fixes especially help on mobile:
- Long draft names wrap properly
- Badges stay on one line
- Buttons don't get cut off
- Navigation fits on smaller screens

## Before & After Summary

### Navigation
```
Before: ★ 🏃 NCAA XC CHAMPS 🏆 ★
After:  NCAA XC DRAFT
```

### Draft Card
```
Before:
🏃‍♂️ Really Long Draft Name Here 🗑️
Status: 🎮 LIVE
Round: 🔄 2/7
Teams: 👥 8
[⚙️ SETUP]

After:
M Really Long Draft Name Here X
Status: LIVE

## Design Philosophy

**Less is More**: The 8-bit aesthetic comes from:
- Pixel font
- Pixel borders
- Retro colors
- Button animations
- Block shadows

**Not from**:
- ❌ Lots of emojis
- ❌ Gaming references everywhere
- ❌ Excessive decorations
- ❌ Cluttered interface

The cleaned-up version feels more like a polished indie game than a cluttered mobile app.

## Next Steps (Optional)

If you want even cleaner:
1. Remove the 🏁 flag from empty state
2. Use text labels instead of "M"/"W" (Men/Women)
3. Reduce grass background opacity
4. Use solid colors instead of striped navigation

But current state is a good balance of **retro fun + professional clean**!
