# ‚úÖ Scraper ACTUALLY Fixed Now!

## What Was Wrong

Based on your debug output, I found the exact issues:

### Issue 1: Wrong Column
**TFRRS Table Structure:**
```
Column 0: PL (Place)
Column 1: NAME
Column 2: YEAR
Column 3: TEAM
Column 4: Avg. Mile  ‚Üê ‚ùå This is PACE (5:11.4)
Column 5: TIME       ‚Üê ‚úÖ This is actual TIME (19:21.0)
Column 6: SCORE
```

The scraper was grabbing column 4 (pace) instead of column 5 (time)!

### Issue 2: Finding Tables
The page has 4 tables:
- Table 0: Women's Team Results (skipped ‚úì)
- Table 1: Women's Individual Results (256 athletes)
- Table 2: Men's Team Results (skipped ‚úì)
- Table 3: Men's Individual Results (256 athletes)

The scraper wasn't correctly identifying which table to use.

### Issue 3: Gender Detection
Headers on the page:
- "Women 6k Run CC Individual Results (6k)"
- "Men 10k Run CC Individual Results (10k)"

The scraper needs to match these to determine gender.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Exact Column Matching
```javascript
// OLD: Look for any "time" column (might get Avg. Mile)
// NEW: Look for column header === "TIME" exactly
const timeCol = headers.findIndex(h => h.toUpperCase() === 'TIME');
```

### 2. Individual vs Team Table Detection
```javascript
// Check if table has NAME column (individual results)
// Team results have "Team" column but no "NAME"
const hasName = headers.some(h => h.toUpperCase() === 'NAME');
```

### 3. Gender Detection from Headers
```javascript
// Find nearest H3 header before the table
// Check if it contains "Women" or "Men"
// Extract distance (6k, 8k, 10k) from header
```

### 4. Parse Actual Data Format
Based on your debug output:
- Name: "Graham Blanks" (column 1)
- Year: "SR-4" (column 2) ‚Üí Display as "SR", store grade as 12
- Team: "Harvard" (column 3)
- Time: "28:37.2" (column 5) ‚Üê Not "4:36.3" from column 4!

## Test It NOW!

### Step 1: Restart Server
```bash
# Stop server (Ctrl+C) then:
npm run dev
```

### Step 2: Clear Bad Data
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/athletes
2. Click "Men" tab
3. Click "Delete All Men"
4. Confirm twice
5. (Optional) Do same for "Women" tab

### Step 3: Import Men's Results
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/import
2. Find "2024 NCAA DI Championships - Men 10K"
3. Click "Import Results"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 4: Verify Results
Go to http://localhost:3000/athletes ‚Üí Men tab

**You SHOULD see:**
- ‚úÖ ~256 male athletes
- ‚úÖ Names: "Graham Blanks", "Habtom Samuel", etc.
- ‚úÖ Schools: "Harvard", "New Mexico", "BYU"
- ‚úÖ Year: "SR", "SO", "JR", "FR"
- ‚úÖ 10K PR column: "28:37.2", "28:38.9", etc. (actual race times!)

**You should NOT see:**
- ‚ùå "Doris Lemngole" or other female names
- ‚ùå Times like "4:36.3" (that's pace, not time)
- ‚ùå Times under 15 minutes

### Step 5: Import Women's Results
1. Go back to Import Data
2. Find "2024 NCAA DI Championships - Women 6K"
3. Click "Import Results"
4. Wait 1-2 minutes

### Step 6: Verify Women's Results
Go to Athletes ‚Üí Women tab

**You SHOULD see:**
- ‚úÖ ~256 female athletes
- ‚úÖ Names: "Doris Lemngole", "Pamela Kosgei", etc.
- ‚úÖ Schools: "Alabama", "New Mexico", etc.
- ‚úÖ 6K PR column: "19:21.0", "19:27.8", etc.

## Expected Results

| Meet | Gender | Athletes | Distance | Example Time | Example Name |
|------|--------|----------|----------|--------------|--------------|
| NCAA DI Champs Men | M | ~256 | 10K | 28:37.2 | Graham Blanks (Harvard) |
| NCAA DI Champs Women | F | ~256 | 6K | 19:21.0 | Doris Lemngole (Alabama) |

## How to Check Success

After import, check Athletes page:

**Men (10K times):**
- First place: ~28:30 - 29:00 range
- Times should be 28-32 minutes
- Should see top NCAA programs (BYU, Iowa State, etc.)

**Women (6K times):**
- First place: ~19:20 - 20:00 range
- Times should be 19-24 minutes
- Should see top NCAA programs

## If It Still Fails

Check the console (terminal where server is running) for:
```
Parsing TFRRS results...
Target gender: M
Found 4 tables on page
Table 0 headers: ["PL", "Team", "Total Time", ...]
Table 0 skipped (team results or wrong format)
Table 1 headers: ["PL", "NAME", "YEAR", "TEAM", "Avg. Mile", "TIME", "SCORE"]
Table 1 detected gender: F, distance: 6K
Table 1 skipped (wrong gender: F !== M)
Table 2 headers: ["PL", "Team", "Total Time", ...]
Table 2 skipped (team results or wrong format)
Table 3 headers: ["PL", "NAME", "YEAR", "TEAM", "Avg. Mile", "TIME", "SCORE"]
Table 3 detected gender: M, distance: 10K
Parsing table 3 as M 10K results
Column indices: PL=0, NAME=1, YEAR=2, TEAM=3, TIME=5
Total parsed: 256 athletes (10K)
```

If you see this, it's working!

## Troubleshooting

**Still getting "No results found":**
- Check server console logs
- Make sure server restarted after code change
- Try the debug tool again

**Getting wrong times:**
- Check which column is being used (should be column 5, TIME)
- Look at console logs for "Column indices"

**Getting wrong gender:**
- Check console logs for "detected gender"
- Make sure you selected right meet (Men vs Women)

**This should work now!** The scraper is built specifically for the exact format shown in your debug output! üéØ
